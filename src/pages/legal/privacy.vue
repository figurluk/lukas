          usage (such as number of visitors and duration of visit) and
          effectiveness (such as topics visitors are most interested in) and to
          allow for ease of navigation or use and, as such, are not associated
          with any personal information, they are also used at times to
          personalize a known visitor's experience to a website by being
          associated with profile information or user preferences. Over time
